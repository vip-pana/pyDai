## Description
The project is a game built in Python that takes place on the terminal. The goal of the game is to find an important object to win, by moving through different rooms. However, the player has a limited number of lives and will lose a life every time they change rooms. The objective of the game is to find the important object before losing all lives.

## Installation and usage

- You need to have Python 3 and Pip installed
- Start the application from the terminal

## Second branch
In the second branch it is possible to find objects in the game, which can act as a bonus or malus for the player. Still not finished so far.
